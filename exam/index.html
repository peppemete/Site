        <h3>Muk</h3>
        <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_EqYSOZLTe9s/TCNCwTChlQI/AAAAAAAAATI/POQmIu4Blyc/s320/57-muk.jpg" alt="Muk Card" height="320" width="229">
        <p>Muk is a stage 1 Pokemon with an hp of 100 which is pretty average for a stage 1 Pokemon card. It is Psychic type and has a +20 hp weakness to Psychic type Pokemon which is fairly low. Muk doesn't have a resistance type and it has a high retreat cost of 3 colorless energy cards. Muk's Poke-Body is called Sludge Cell and says that if Muk is affected by a Special Condition between turns remove 2 damage counters. This is a really good Poke-Body for Muk considering that in one of its moves it can poison itself which only adds 1 damage counter per turn, so you want to poison Muk and then you'll be able to remove 1 damage counter per turn. Muk has two moves, the first one is called Strange Poison, this move requires two energy cards, one Psychic and one colorless, it does 30 hp damage and when you use this move you are to flip a coin if it is heads, the defending Pokemon is poisoned, if it is tails Muk is poisoned. Muk's second move is called Strange Sludge, and this move takes 3 energy cards, two Psychic and one colorless. This move does 50 hp damage but if Muk is poisoned this move does 70 hp damage and the defending Pokemon is now confused. As far as strategy goes I would definitely want to have Muk be poisoned so I could use its Poke-Body, to do this I would use Strange Poison until Muk gets poisoned. Hopefully while I'm doing this I flip a heads first so the defending Pokemon becomes poisoned that way when I use Strange Sludge once Muk is poisoned, so I can do 70 damage instead of 50, the Pokemon not only will become confused but it will pretty much do a major amount of damage to itself because it will do 10 damage already to itself from the poison and hopefully attack itself when it is confused. So this card is very powerful and will wreak havoc on the defending Pokemon making them afflicted with multiple special conditions. I really like this card, especially for an uncommon card, so I would definitely consider it in a poison type deck or even a Psychic type deck. So thanks for reading my review and stay tuned for tomorrow's review of Jirachi from Unleashed.</p>

        <p> Ho-oh has 90 hp, Ho-oh is a basic, fire type Pokemon and has a x2 weakness to water type Pokemon but also like Lugia has a -30 resistance to fighting type Pokemon and a 2 colorless energy card retreat cost. Surprisingly Ho-oh has 3 moves, the first move is called Stoke and this move requires 1 fire energy card, this move lets you search your deck for a fire energy card and attach it to Ho-oh so you can basically attach two cards at once to Ho-oh when you use this move. Ho-oh's second move is called Sacred Fire and this move require 3 fire energy cards, this move does 40 hp damage to one of your opponent's Pokemon but since this is an older card you have to flip a coin first and get heads to even do damage with this move. Ho-oh's final move is called Dive Bomb and requires 5 fire energy cards and does 90 damage but you have to again flip a coin with this move and if it is tails it doesn't do anything at all. So you take a risk with this card and stack up the energy cards on this card and could even waste a turn by trying Dive Bomb and getting tails. But since this is an older card 90 damage is way more damage than it is by today's cards so I would definitely risk a turn doing the 90 damage. I won't rate this card because it is too old and doesn't compare to newer cards but this is another card I would be willing to trade for if it is in mint condition, if you want to trade me this card or the Lugia card you can message me on YouTube with a list of cards you want and I'll see if we can work this card out, so thanks for reading today's review of Ho-oh from Neo Revelation stay tuned for tomorrow's review of Glaceon from Majestic Dawn.</p>
