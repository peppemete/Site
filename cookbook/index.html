                <li>500g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
                <li>300g carrots, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
                <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>    
                <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li> 
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>1l vegetable stock</li>

        <article>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/ gas 7 and put the sweet potatoes and carrots into a large roasting tin, drizzled with 2 tbsp olive oil and plenty of seasoning. Roast the veg in the oven for 25-30 mins or until caramelised and tender.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, put the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil in a large deep saucepan and fry the onion over a medium-low heat for about 10 mins until softened. Add the garlic and stir for 1 min before adding the stock. Simmer for 5-10 mins until the onions are very soft, then set aside.</p>
            <p>Once the roasted veg is done, leave to cool a little, then transfer to the saucepan and use a hand blender to process until smooth. Stir in the crème fraîche, a little more seasoning and reheat until hot. Serve in bowls topped with a swirl of crème fraîche and a good grinding of black pepper.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>450g butternut squash, peeled and chopped</li>
                <li>25g butter</li>
                <li>generous grating nutmeg</li>    
                <li>25g vegetarian parmesan -style cheese, coarsely grated</li> 
            </ul>
            <h4>For the porcini dressing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp finely chopped dried porcini mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>To serve</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>generous pinch saffron</li>
                <li>85g chestnut mushrooms, quartered</li>
                <li>1 fat garlic clove, shredded</li>
                <li>100g bag baby spinach</li>
                <li>4 sheets fresh lasagne, halved</li>
                <li>shavings of parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), optional</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>Put the squash and butter in a pan with 5 tbsp water. Tightly cover pan and cook for 15 mins until the squash is just tender, but not coloured. Roughly mash with seasoning, nutmeg and Parmesan.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, make the dressing. Put the chopped porcini in a small bowl with 3 tbsp boiling water. Cover with cling film and cook for 1 min in the microwave on High, then leave to cool. Mix 1 tbsp oil with the vinegar and soy, then add the soaked mushrooms with almost all of the liquid (leave the last drop behind as it might contain grit).</p>
            <p>To serve, boil a pan of water with the saffron and some salt for 5 mins to extract some colour and flavour. Meanwhile, fry the mushrooms in the remaining oil. When they are nearly cooked, add the garlic so that it browns and crisps, but doesn’t burn. Pierce the bag of spinach and wilt in the microwave for 1 min. Reheat the squash in the microwave, too.</p>
            <p>Boil the lasagne for 1 min until just tender, then drain. Put 3 little piles of spinach on 2 warm serving plates. Top each with a square of lasagne, then a spoonful of squash – spread it out a little, add a few spinach leaves, then top with another square of pasta. Continue these layers until you end up with a stack of 4 layers of pasta on each plate, then top each with a spoonful of squash. Scatter round the garlicky mushrooms, Prepare ahead</p>
            <p>The squash can be mashed and the dressing made up to 2 days ahead; keep them both covered in the fridge. To serve, reheat the squash in a pan or in the microwave and take the dressing out to come to room temperature generously spoon over the dressing, or allow guest to help themselves at the table, and sprinkle over some Parmesan shavings, if you like.</p>

                <li>3 tbsp black treacle</li>

                <li>1½ tsp ground ginger</li>
                <li>3 good pinches of ground cloves</li>
                <li>300ml buttermilk</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>3 tbsp dark rum (optional – replace with extra milk, if you like)</li>
                <li>1½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

                <li>200g smooth caramelised biscuit spread (I used Lotus Biscoff biscuit spread)</li>
                <li>50g desiccated coconut, to decorate</li>
                <li>silver edible glitter (optional)</li>
                <li>gingerbread shapes (see tip)</li>
            </ul>

        <article>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>Measure the milk and treacle into a saucepan (grease the measuring spoon with a little oil first and the treacle will easily slide off). Bring to a gentle simmer and stir until combined, then set aside to cool. Meanwhile, grease 3 x 20cm loose-bottomed cake tins with a little oil and line the bases with baking parchment (if you don’t have enough cake tins, see tip). If the tins are any shallower than 4cm, line the sides with a deep collar too. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</p>

            <p>Measure the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and spices into a large bowl, then add 1/2 tsp fine salt. Mix the dry ingredients together with a large whisk; if there are any large lumps of sugar, squeeze these through your fingers until you have an even, sandy-textured mixture.</p>

            <p>In a jug, whisk the oil, buttermilk, eggs, rum and vanilla. Add the milk and treacle mixture, and mix well. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and whisk into a smooth batter. Divide between the tins and bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. You may have to swap the cakes over to cook evenly, but don’t do this until they’ve had at least 20 mins cooking. Cool the cakes in their tins for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack, peel off the parchment and leave to cool completely. Once cooled, you can wrap the sponges in cling film and store in a cool place for 4 days, or freeze for up to 2 months – the texture and flavour will be all the better for it.</p>

            <p>To make the icing, put the butter and half the icing sugar in a large bowl. Mash together roughly with a spatula, then whizz with an electric hand whisk until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar, the cream cheese, vanilla bean extract and biscuit spread. Mix again until smooth and evenly mixed. Transfer half the icing to another bowl and set aside. Use the remaining icing to stack the cakes and cover the entire outside in a thin layer – don’t worry about making the cake look too neat at this stage, as any crumbs trapped in the icing will be covered in the final coat. Chill the cake for 30 mins and the remaining icing for 20 mins (remove the icing from the fridge 10 mins before the cake to soften a little).</p>

            <p>When the icing on the cake is firm, remove it from the fridge and use the remaining icing to cover the cake. Smooth the sides using a palette knife, but leave peaks and dips on top for your snow scene. Top the cake generously with desiccated coconut, a dusting of sieved icing sugar and some edible glitter, if you like, then decorate the top and sides with gingerbread shapes (see tip). If you’re not eating the cake within a few hours, store it in the fridge, but bring back to room temperature before serving. Wlll keep for 2 days.</p>
